## Analysis-of-air-pollution-levels-and-its-contributing-factors-using-Machine-Learning-models
	Worked with Beijing City’s pollution data.

	Used various machine learning models to predict the particulate matter(pm2.5) value taking the wind speed, temperature, wind direction, date, and time as the predictor variables.

	Discovered an interesting pattern in the outlier data and analyzed it further to understand the data's revelation. 

	Achieved an RMSE score of around 20 - 21
